# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TouchGanttChart is a WPF application built with .NET 9.0 that provides touch-enabled Gantt chart functionality. The application uses modern C# patterns with nullable reference types and implicit usings enabled.

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run

# Build for release
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Restore packages
dotnet restore
```

## Architecture

The codebase follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **src/Models/**: Domain models and entities
- **src/ViewModels/**: MVVM view models using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- **src/Views/**: WPF views, controls, and dialogs
- **src/Services/**: Business logic with interface/implementation separation
- **src/Data/**: Data access layer using Entity Framework Core with SQLite
- **src/Resources/**: XAML styles, templates, and application resources

## Key Dependencies

- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm**: MVVM framework for view models and commanding
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting**: Dependency injection and hosting
- **Entity Framework Core**: Data access with SQLite provider
- **Serilog**: Structured logging to file and console
- **MahApps.Metro**: Modern UI framework for WPF
- **IronPdf**: PDF export functionality
- **xUnit**: Testing framework

## Database

The application uses Entity Framework Core with SQLite as the database provider. Migration commands:

```bash
# Add new migration
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>

# Update database
dotnet ef database update

# Drop database
dotnet ef database drop
```

## Testing

Tests are organized in the `tests/` directory with separate projects for unit and integration tests. Use xUnit as the testing framework.
